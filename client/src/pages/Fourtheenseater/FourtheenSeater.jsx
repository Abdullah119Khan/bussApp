              The 14-seater Van rental with drivers is available in Dubai and
              Abu Dhabi for cheap rates. The longer you rent it, the cheaper it
              gets. Our standard minivans seat 13 persons, but we can provide
              you with a 14-seater if this is your requirement. We have a medium
              size luggage van that can accommodate up to 14 passengers. If your
              group is larger than 14 persons or if your luggage takes up more
              than 14 medium size bags, we recommend hiring Micro size vehicles.

              To make it easier for small groups, we offer a large vehicle with
              one driver: the 22-seater Van. This Minibus has a high-roofed
              compartment that can fit 13 to 16 persons. It is equipped with 1
              seat for the driver and the remaining 16 are available for
              passengers and their luggage. It is good for 16 passengers
              including their 12 medium-size bags or suitcases. The same vehicle
              should not be used in the case of professional luxury trips or
              city tours because it is recommended that 14 basic seats be used
              by 14 people according to their bag sizes.
